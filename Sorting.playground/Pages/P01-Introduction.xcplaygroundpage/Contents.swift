 # Sorting

 When programming with collections of data, one of the most common operations performed is sorting. Just think of all the ways in which you use sorting in everyday software:
 
 - Emails ordered by date received
 - Music albums shown alphabetically by title
 - Address book contacts sorted by last or first name
 - Facebook posts arranged by most recent post date
 - To do items displayed in priority order
 
 In each of these examples and in countless more, a collection of data is sorted to provide the viewer with a more useful representation of that data. After all, the computer doesn't really care how data is sorted - it's all the same data. But when we are deciding how that data should be rendered or otherwise operated upon, sorting becomes a crucial factor.
 
 Most sorting algorithms are comparison-based, meaning the sort algorithm uses multiple swaps of two elements. In the following sections, you'll first learn how to swap two elements in an `Array`, and then start to build your first sorting function. We will use a deck of cards as an example since they are easy to visualize.
